## How to Run
This demo is using node.js, express, and socket.io on the server. If node.js is installed on your local device, you can call "node server.js"
from the main directory (the one with the server.js file in it). The server will be accessible on port 3000 of the hosting device (ex. localhost:3000).

## How to Use
The idea is that you can open multiple browser windows and access the server, where input onto the canvas box in each browser window is shown as output in
all browser windows. Clicking down and dragging with a cursor within the canvas will cause randomly colored lines to be drawn across the clients.
